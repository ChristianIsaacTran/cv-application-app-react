# purpose of this repo

- This is the first react project in the react section of the odin project, and its right after the lessons about useStates() 
in react and how they work. 

- The goal is to setup a small CV form app 
where the user enters in information into the app and they can either submit it or 
edit it based on the form buttons in each section.
